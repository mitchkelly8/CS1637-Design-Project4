# CS1637-Design-Project4

Below is a list of all the artifacts for my Design Project 4 submission. The link to the Video Walkthrough, Adobe XD Clickable Prototype, and Mr. Party are embedded in the ReadMe. The written report and design evaluation have been checked into this repository. 

## Artifacts 

### Video Walkthrough 
The video walkthrough can be accessed through [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CSYxAq9PXnQ) or [OneDrive](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mjk139_pitt_edu/EdcOkY-D4d9KkO_Q5ahLF54BLMAT7qjE2u-gp4eIfNN4UQ?e=cbzvps). It contains: 
- A brief explanation of Mr. Party
- A walkthrough of the Adobe XD clickable prototype
- Comparison between the Adobe XD design and the live version Mr. Party 

### Adobe XD Clickable Prototype
The Adobe XD clickable prototype showcases the design changes that I intend to implement to make the service more relevant in a world with COVID-19. 

### Mr. Party
Mr. Party is an iPhone application available for download on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mr-party/id1213486893). If you use Spotify or Apple Music, I would recommend downloading the application to get a better idea of what it does. Additional information about the application can be found on the [Mr. Party Website](https://www.mrpartyapp.com/).

### Written Report 
The written report has been checked into this repository. As stated in the project requirements, the written report contains: 
- The problem that motivates your new technology solution. Explain how you researched this problem. Explain the population effected, explain the population that will use the technology (if different). Explain if the problem is unique to COVID, or just made worse or different. 
- Describe the tasks supported. Explain what the users use your technology to do.
- Describe the design and evaluation methods you employed in your design process. Justify why they were chosen. Explain what was learned through each use. 

### Design Evaluation
The design evaluation has been checked into this repository. The design evaluation contains: 
- Justification of the design against general design principles. 
- Justification of the design against guidelines. 
- Justification of the design against theories. 
- Information about technology specific affordances. 
- Details from congitive walkthroughs.
