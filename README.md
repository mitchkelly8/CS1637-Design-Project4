### Video Walkthrough 
The video walkthrough can be accessed through YouTube or OneDrive. It contains: 
- A brief explanation of Mr. Party
- A walkthrough of the Adobe XD clickable prototype
- Comparison between the Adobe XD design and the exiting Mr. Party 

### Adobe XD Clickable Prototype
The Adobe XD clickable prototype showcases the design changes that I intend to implement to make the service more relevant in a world with COVID-19. 

### Mr. Party
Mr. Party is an iPhone application available for download on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mr-party/id1213486893). If you use Spotify or Apple Music, I would recommend downloading the application to get a better idea of what it does. Additional information about the application can be found on the [Mr. Party Website](https://www.mrpartyapp.com/).
